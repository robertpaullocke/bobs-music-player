looking to make my own music player
  What I'm looking  for  is  some  one  to  help  me  create  an mp3  player  for  windows 7 that not  only plays music, but 
  tells  you  the  time,  date, weather,  news  headlines, and  has multiple djs.  from morning, noon, evening,
  late night, and mid night to 6  am. I  know  this  seems  like a  lot but  its  my  own personal dream. can 
  any one  help?
